Question: What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? 
That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code,
and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?

Answer: An important part goes beyond the mere passing of the tests and
investigating to make sure the tests cover edge cases. Another important
part is making sure there's enough coverage in the tests.

Question: We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty 
confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How
could containers help us improve this situation?

Answer: A container would resolve this issue by isolating the specific
program/code you want to run into an environment that has all the 
dependencies it needs. And not just packages but the entire environment.
This makes it so any computer that runs that container, gets with it all
the necessary parts to make it work
